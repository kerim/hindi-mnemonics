# Hindi Vocabulary Mnemonic Generator

Use this skill when the user asks you to create mnemonics for Hindi vocabulary words.

## Core Principles

1. **First syllable priority (flexible)**: The first syllable of the mnemonic word should almost perfectly match the first syllable of the target Hindi word
   - **EXCEPTION**: If a really strong match exists for the second syllable with a slightly off-key first syllable, this can be acceptable
   - **EXCEPTION**: If the phrase is a common idiom/expression whose overall meaning matches the target word, individual syllable-words don't need to carry the meaning
2. **DIRECT imagery**: The mnemonic words themselves should directly evoke the meaning, not through round-about connections
   - GOOD: "sun" → SOARING RAYS (rays directly relate to sun)
   - BAD: "sun" → SUE the RAJAH (suing a king has no direct connection to sun)
   - **EXCEPTION**: Idiomatic phrases where the phrase as a whole carries the meaning (see below)
3. **Complete coverage**: Include all syllables when possible (perfect matches not required for later syllables, but don't skip them unless truly difficult)
4. **Ideal outcome**: Capture multiple syllables with a single memorable phrase/image where the words directly describe or relate to the target meaning

## Mnemonic Structure

Each mnemonic should include:

- **Target word**: Hindi word in Devanagari with transliteration
- **Meaning**: English translation
- **Mnemonic phrase**: Capitalized sound-matching words with image
- **Sound mapping**: Show how mnemonic maps to Hindi syllables
- **Visual image**: Brief description of the memorable scene

## Example Format

**Word**: स्वादिष्ट (svādiṣṭ)
**Meaning**: delicious

**Mnemonic**: SWAllowing a DISH (of tea cakes)

**Sound mapping**: swa-DISH(-t) → स्वादिष्ट

**Image**: Someone so excited by the delicious smell that they swallow an entire dish of tea cakes in one gulp - dish and all! Their eyes bulge comically as the whole porcelain dish slides down their throat

---

**Idiomatic Phrase Examples** (where the whole phrase carries the meaning):

**Word**: आवाज़ (āvāz)
**Meaning**: voice, sound

**Mnemonic**: AS I VUZ saying
**Sound mapping**: AZ I VUZ → आवाज़ (with "I was" pronounced with slight lisp/German accent)
**Image**: Someone repeatedly saying "as I was saying" to regain attention - their voice trying to be heard

(Note: "As I was saying" is an idiomatic phrase about speaking/voice. The phrase as a whole conveys the meaning, even though individual words like "as" or "I" don't mean "voice")

---

**Word**: अंतिम (antim)
**Meaning**: final, last

**Mnemonic**: for the UMpTEENth time!
**Sound mapping**: UM-TEEN(th) → अंतिम
**Sound mapping**: UN-TEEM → अंतिम
**Image**: Someone exasperatedly saying "for the umpteenth time!" - implying this is the final warning

(Note: "For the umpteenth time" is an idiomatic expression conveying finality/lastness. First syllable match is slightly off, but strong second syllable match + idiomatic meaning makes it excellent)

---

**Good Example - Direct Imagery**:

**Word**: सूरज (sūraj)
**Meaning**: sun

**Option 1**: SOARING RAYS
**Sound mapping**: SŌR(-ing) RAYS → सूरज
**Image**: Rays of sunlight soaring upward from the horizon at dawn

**Option 2**: SUN RAYS
**Sound mapping**: SUN RAYS → सूरज
**Image**: The sun's rays streaming through clouds

(Note: The mnemonic words "soaring rays" and "sun rays" DIRECTLY describe aspects of the sun itself)

---

**Bad Example - Round-about Connections**:

**Word**: सूरज (sūraj)
**Meaning**: sun

**Option 1**: SUE the RAJAH
**Image**: A lawyer suing a rajah in an outdoor courtroom where the sun is blazing

(Note: This is BAD because "suing a king" has no direct connection to "sun" - the sun is only added as background scenery, not inherent to the mnemonic words)

## Instructions

When the user provides Hindi vocabulary:

1. Analyze the syllable structure and meaning
2. Find English words/phrases that match the syllables AND relate to the target meaning
3. Consider TWO approaches:
   - **Direct match**: Words that directly describe the meaning + match the sound
   - **Idiomatic match**: Common phrases/expressions whose overall meaning matches, even if individual words don't
4. **CRITICAL**: The mnemonic words must INHERENTLY evoke the meaning, not require adding unrelated imagery as "scenery"
5. **ALWAYS generate 5 different mnemonic options** for each word
6. **FLEXIBILITY**: Include 1-2 idiomatic phrase options if they provide excellent sound matches, even with slightly off first syllables
7. Present all 5 options in the format shown above

**IMPORTANT**:
- Always provide exactly 5 different mnemonic options for each Hindi word
- Most options should use direct imagery (words themselves relate to meaning)
- 1-2 options can use idiomatic phrases if the phrase as a whole conveys the meaning well
- Avoid round-about connections where the meaning is only added as background context

Focus on creating mnemonics that are:
- **UNFORGETTABLE**: This is CRITICAL - boring mnemonics won't stick! Make them funny, shocking, absurd, or surprising
- **Sound-accurate**: Prioritize first syllable precision (with flexibility for idiomatic phrases)
- **Meaningful**: The image should clearly connect to the word's meaning
- **Complete**: Cover all syllables when feasible

## The Memorability Requirement

**CRITICAL**: A mnemonic that doesn't stick in your memory is useless. Each mnemonic must be:
- **Unusual** - Not just any ordinary phrase
- **Funny** - Humor makes things memorable
- **Shocking** - Unexpected or surprising elements help retention
- **Vivid** - Create a clear, striking mental image
- **Emotional** - Evoke a reaction (laughter, surprise, disgust, delight)

**Boring mnemonics to AVOID**:
- Plain descriptions without energy
- Generic phrases that don't evoke emotion
- Forgettable imagery

**Memorable mnemonics to AIM FOR**:
- Exaggerated, over-the-top scenarios
- Absurd combinations that make you laugh
- Slightly shocking or unexpected imagery
- Things that make you go "That's ridiculous... but I'll never forget it!"

## Tips for Strong Mnemonics

- **Start with the meaning**: Think of words directly related to the target meaning that also match the sound
- **Consider idioms**: Think of common phrases/expressions related to the meaning that might match the sound
- **Amp up the drama**: Use action verbs for dynamic, energetic imagery
- **Go extreme**: Exaggerate size, quantity, emotion, or absurdity
- **Add surprise**: Include unexpected twists or shocking elements
- Capitalize the sound-matching portions
- Include sensory details (taste, touch, sight, sound, smell)
- **Make it ridiculous**: If it makes you chuckle or go "wow, that's weird," it's working
- **TEST 1**: If you removed the image description, would the mnemonic words alone (or phrase as a whole) suggest the meaning? If not, find different words.
- **TEST 2**: Would you actually remember this a week from now? If not, make it more memorable!

## How to Avoid Round-about Connections

**Ask yourself**: Do the mnemonic words themselves relate to the meaning, or am I forcing a connection by adding the meaning as scenery in the image description?

**GOOD - Direct**: "sun" → SOARING RAYS (rays are literally part of what the sun is)
**GOOD - Idiomatic**: "voice" → AS I WAS SAYING (common phrase about speaking)
**GOOD - Idiomatic**: "final" → FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME (expression conveying finality, even with slightly off first syllable but excellent second syllable match)

**BAD**: "sun" → SUE ROGER (suing someone has nothing to do with sun; the sun is added artificially to the scene)

**Strategy**:
1. Brainstorm words/phrases related to the target meaning first
2. Check which ones match the sound pattern (being flexible about first syllable if the phrase is idiomatic)
3. Amp up the memorability - make it funny, shocking, or absurd
4. Don't find sound matches first and force the meaning in afterward
5. Don't settle for boring imagery - keep pushing until it's unforgettable
